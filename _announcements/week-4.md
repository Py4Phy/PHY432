In Week 4 we will learn about two fundamental Python packages for
**scientific computing**:

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), which makes available N-dimensional
  arrays and functions to work with these arrays.
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), a comprehensive library for
  creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

We will use **NumPy** arrays as the basic data structure for most of our
algorithms and applications, simply because most of Physics can be
described as scalar series (e.g., time series), vectors, or
tensors. NumPy will enable us to write concise and fast code that
operates on these data structures.

Furthermore, all scientific Python packages have adopted the NumPy
array as the common data structure so using it makes it easy to work
with other packages, too.

**matplotlib** works seamlessly with NumPy arrays and makes it easy to
create 2D plots. It is essential for analyzing the output from our
programs. It also has 3D plotting capabilities that we will
explore. With some practice, matplotlib can produce publication-ready
plots --- no more manual graph making in a spread sheet
program... Furthermore, because you create graphs by writing Python
code, you can fully automate graph creation, which ultimately leads to
enhanced productivity and more consistent plots with fewer
errors. 

Knowing NumPy and matplotlib is absolutely essential when doing
scientific programming in Python.
