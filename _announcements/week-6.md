In Week 6 we will start a long module on **solving ordinary
differential equations** (ODEs). ODEs underpin many problems in
Physics and even though we can sometimes solve them analytically, this
is often not possible. Starting from numerical differentiation, we
will develop discretization algorithms that allow us to solve *any*
system of coupled ODEs (linear or non-linear) numerically. 

We will then discuss different *integrator* algorithms and see the
trade-offs in accuracy and stability and how they are related to
deeper symmetries present in the physical problem.
