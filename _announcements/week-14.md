In the last week we will explore **Monte Carlo methods** --- a
powerful numerical approach to evaluate high dimensional integrals
that relies on random numbers. Monte Carlo approaches can be used to
sample from any kind of distributions and are therefore suitable to
directly simulate physical systems according to the Boltzmann
distribution, which underpins statistical mechanics of, for example,
simple models of magnetism.
