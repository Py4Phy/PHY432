A common problem is to **find the roots** $$x_0$$ of an equation,
$$f(x_0)=0$$. We will develop two algorithms to find roots
numerically. The *bisection* algorithm is a simple and robust approach
that exemplifies how to go from imagining a solution ("how would I
solve this problem?") to an actual implementation. We then will
develop a much faster but less robust algorithm known as
*Newton-Raphson*. In both cases we will initially restrict ourselves
to 1D problems. We then find that we can easily extend Newton-Raphson
to arbitrary dimensions to solve $$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_0) =
\mathbf{0}$$ but we will need to learn how solve *matrix equations*,
which directly leads us into **linear algebra**.
