A common problem is to find the roots of an equation. We will develop
two algorithms to find roots numerically. The *bisection* algorithm is
a simple and robust approach that exemplifies how to go from imagining
a solution ("how would I solve this problem?") to an actual
implementation. We then will develop a much faster but less robust
algorithm known as *Newton-Raphson*. In both cases we will initially
restrict ourselves to 1D problems but we will later extend
Newton-Raphson to arbitrary dimensions (once we learned how to solve
matrix problems).
