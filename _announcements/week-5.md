In Week 5 we will use NumPy and matplotlib to analyze an ensemble of
Brownian dynamics (random walk) trajectories, which concludes our
example on using numpy and matplotlib.

We will then learn about fundamentals of numerical computations,
namely how numbers are represented in the computer and what errors one
expects in numerical calculations. These two topics are tightly
linked and surprisingly, the random walk will show up again in a
completely different context.
