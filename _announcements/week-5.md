In Week 5 we will learn about fundamentals of numerical computations,
namely how numbers are represented in the computer and what errors one
expects in numerical calculations. These two topics are tightly
linked. We will also learn how to differentiate numerically, a first
step towards solving ordinary differential equations in Week 6.
