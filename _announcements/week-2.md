As a computational scientist you want to have a number of tools in
your (virtual) tool belt to get your work done. In Week 1 we already
learned to [use the command line]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% link
modules/setup_unix/Unix_Shell.md %}), namely `bash`.

In Week 2 we will learn to use the [git](https://git-scm.com/) source
code management tool, a distributed version control system (VCS), that
is widely used in the open source communities and in industry. A VCS
keeps track of multiple files in a project and allows multiple people
to work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.

We will also review the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming
language. Python is widely used in the sciences (and in industry) and
provides everything one needs to solve problems in virtually all areas
you can think of.
