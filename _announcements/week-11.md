For the next two weeks we will learn how to solve **partial
differential equations** (PDEs). PDEs underpin all manner of physical
phenomena, as soon as a quantity depends on more than one independent
variable. Commonly the independent variables are the three dimensions
of space and time. Unlike [ordinary differential
equations]({{ site.beasurl }}{% link modules/ODEs/ODEs.md%}), there's
no "one size fits all" approach. For different types of equations we
will need different algorithms. We start with problems in
electrostatic (Poisson's equation), move to diffusion and heat
conduction problems (diffusion equation), and close with wave problems
(wave equation).
