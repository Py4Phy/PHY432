Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are one of the fundamental ways
in which we describe relationships between quantities in
physics. There exists a standard approach to formalize systems of ODEs
(the *standard form*) that enables an efficient way to solve them
numerically with *integrator algorithms*, which we implement with
Python/NumPy.
